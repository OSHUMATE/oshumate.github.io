    <h1>The History of HTML</h1>

    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, was first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. Initially, HTML was a simple language designed to format text and link documents over the web. The first version only supported a limited set of tags, which were used to structure and hyperlink text. Over time, the language evolved to include features that supported multimedia, scripting, and more.</p>

    <p>By the mid-1990s, HTML became the standard for creating web pages, with the introduction of versions like HTML 2.0 and HTML 3.2. Later, organizations like the W3C and WHATWG began to maintain and standardize its development. HTML5, released in 2014, revolutionized the language by adding support for modern features like audio, video, and semantic elements. Today, HTML continues to be the foundation of the World Wide Web.</p>
